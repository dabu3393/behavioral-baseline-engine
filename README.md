# Behavioral Baseline Engine

A baseline-first engine that learns normal behavior, persists baselines, and flags deviations with context.

Goals:
- Baseline is a first-class artifact
- Reusable across domains (latency, auth failures, DNS volume, etc.)
- Calm, production-adjacent Python design (not a demo script)
